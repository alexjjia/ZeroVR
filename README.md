##Notes
What originally started out as a "let's see if such and such is even possible to do" at HackBU Spring 2017, has somehow gone off course and evolved into a mech-like game.
So...yeah. It's a fun little side project that I plan on working on in my spare time from school work / other stuff. Future implementations to be determined soon!



##To-Do List
1. _Fix Aiming_. Right now, I've statically set the player's left and right cannons to shoot where the reticle is pointing, but it's only accurate *at long ranges*. This basically means that at close range, it's not even worth trying to aim.
Therefore, it's imperative that I set the barrels to dynamically adjust according to where the reticle is pointing (i.e it will theoretically be accurate at all available distances).
2. Other Stuff. Haven't thought of it yet, but probably involves implementing other features / buttons.
